## Overview

A collection of all the user-defined functions I commonly use, including
both the well-documented functions from my other repos, and any
work-in-progress functions Iâ€™m currently developing.

Most of the less experimental functions included in this package can be
found in [vary](https://github.com/ulchc/vary).

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ulchc/ulchr")
```

## Usage

After installation from GitHub, you can load it with:

``` r
library(ulchr)
```

## R Documentation

Use ?ulchr in R to view a linked list of all functions
