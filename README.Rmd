## Overview
A collection of all the user-defined functions I commonly use, including both the well-documented functions from my other repos, and any work-in-progress functions I'm currently developing. 

Most of the less experimental functions included in this package can be found in [vary](https://github.com/ulchc/vary).

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ulchc/ulchr")
```

## Usage

After installation from GitHub, you can load it with:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(ulchr)
```

## R Documentation

Use ?ulchr in R to view a linked list of all functions
